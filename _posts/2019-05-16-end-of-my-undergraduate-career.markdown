So today was the last final I had of my undergraduate career (well I hope so!). This semester was in many ways a microcosm of my college career as whole, full of its ups and downs but finally ending. It's been a long ride and I've learned quite a bit in the five years it took me to get my degree. As long as I pass my classes this semester, I'll officially have my BS in Computer Science and on my way to Richmond to start my career as a software engineer at Capital One in August.
