As I mentioned, I'll be graduating in exactly two weeks at NJIT. It's been a long road and I encountered a few roadblocks along the way (who doesn't?) but in the end, I'm glad I finally have that degree and diploma. Finally, I can say that I have a college degree and not simply working towards one. I'm having conflicting thoughts. Part of me is happy to be finally be done with college. It's been a long and hard road and as anyone can attest to, CS is a difficult major with long hours and stressful, sleepless nights. Another part of me is nostalgic for what I've accomplished as well as the friends I've made along the way.
