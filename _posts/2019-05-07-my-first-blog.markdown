Hello and welcome to my blogs. I will be updating this periodically with new posts regarding my personal projects and things I would like to learn. Once I begin my job at Capital One, I plan on blogging about my experiences there. 

{% highlight python %}
def hello_world(name):
    return("Hello, %s!" % name)
print(hello_world('Uday'))
#=> prints 'Hello, Uday!' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
