Hello all and welcome to my website. I am currently a Software Engineer at Southwest Airlines in Chicago, IL. I graduated in May 2019 from the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, NJ with a BS in Computer Science. I previously worked as a Software Engineer for Capital One in Richmond, VA. This is my website where I plan to blog about my adventures in software engineering and my own personal endeavors. 

I hope you enjoy!
