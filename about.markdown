Hello all and welcome to my website. I am currently a Software Engineer at Capital One in Richmond, VA and a recent graduate of the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, NJ in Computer Science. This is my website where I plan to blog about my adventures in software engineering and my own personal endeavors. 

I hope you enjoy!
